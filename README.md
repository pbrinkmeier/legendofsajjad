# Legend of Sajjad 
Minigame. Don't expect anything spectacular. Yet.

# TODO
## Necessary features
- let player move freely even if the camera can't move anymore (borders/corners of the map)
- bossfights (AI, animation of announcement message boxes etc.)
- ending screen, death screen, maybe a start screen with a simple tutorial on the important keyboard buttons
- working sound (SDL_mixer)

## Code cleanup / enhancement tasks
- add "spritesheet" and "animation" abstraction classes to ease adding new sprites
- resource "server" loading the spritesheets, sounds etc.

## Maybe adding this in the future, if I get the time
- powerups (new weapons, speed boost, invincibility)
- different floor tiles/worldmaps
- different boss/penguin AIs to randomly choose from
- font rendering to show important (or plain silly) information (fps, deaths, shot penguins etc.)

# Known bugs
- none (yet)
